        <h4>main performance</h4>      
        <p>In paragraph 1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UNFCCC distinguishes between "climate change", where human activities alter the composition of the atmosphere, and "climate variability" due to natural causes. Climate change is mainly manifested in three aspects: Global Warming, Acid rain, Ozone Depletion. Global Warming is the most urgent problem for mankind, and it is related to the future of mankind!</p>

        <h4>Formation reasons</h4>        
        <p>The causes of climate change may be natural internal processes, external forcings, or persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere and land use. There are both natural and man-made factors. Among the human factors, it is mainly caused by human activities since the industrial Revolution, especially the economic activities in the process of industrialization in developed countries. The greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning, deforestation, land use change and other human activities lead to a significant increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the intensification of the greenhouse effect, thus causing global warming. According to the Oak Ridge Laboratory research report, since 1750, the global cumulative emissions of more than 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, of which developed countries accounted for about 80%. What are the effects of climate change? Climate change has led to more catastrophic weather events, accelerated melting of glaciers and snow, uneven distribution of water resources and threats to biodiversity. Climate change is also causing sea level rise, and coastal areas are more severely affected by natural disasters such as floods and storms. Small island states and low-lying coastal areas are even threatened with inundation. Climate change has a negative impact on agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing and other economic and social activities, exacerbates the spread of diseases, and threatens social and economic development and people's health. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), all regions of the world are likely to be adversely affected if temperatures rise by more than 2.5 ° C, with developing countries particularly affected. If the temperature rises by 4, it may cause irreversible damage to the global ecosystem and cause significant losses to the global economy. According to China's national Assessment Report on Climate Change released in 2006, the impacts of climate change on China are mainly in agriculture, water resources, natural ecosystems and coastal zones. May lead to instability of agricultural production increase, the south floods, intensified the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources in the north, forest and grassland ecosystem degradation, biological disasters, such as biological diversity decline, frequent typhoon and storm tide, coastal strip disaster and the relevant major engineering construction and operation safety.</p>
        <p>One of the main causes of the greenhouse effect is greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse effect is reinforced by increases in greenhouse gases, of which carbon dioxide is the most abundant. The burning of long-wave radiant natural gas from the earth's surface now produces far more carbon dioxide than ever before. On the other hand, due to deforestation, a large amount of farmland has been built into cities and factories, destroying vegetation and reducing the conditions for converting carbon dioxide into organic matter. In addition, the surface waters gradually shrink, greatly reduce the precipitation, reduce the absorption of dissolved carbon dioxide conditions, destroy the dynamic balance of carbon dioxide generation and transformation, so that the atmospheric carbon dioxide content increased year by year. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the air increases, the earth's temperature changes.</p>
