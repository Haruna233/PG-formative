  <p>Climate change refers to the change of climate mean over time, that is, one or 
    both of climate mean and deviation (anomaly) together appear statistically significant changes. 
    The larger the deviation value is, the greater the magnitude of climate change is and the
     more unstable the climate state is. Generally refers to the change of climate state at 
     any time scale.<br> They range from the longest several billion years to the shortest 
     interannual variation. It can be divided into geological climate change, historical 
     climate change and modern climate change. The scale of climate change in geological 
     period is about 104 ~ 108 years, mainly based on animal and plant fossils and various 
     traces of indirect research. It has been proved that there were several alternations 
     between glacial and interglacial periods during the period. The scale of climate change 
     in the historical period is about 102 to 103 years, during which human beings appeared,
      mainly based on historical documents, changes of flora and fauna, tree ring analysis 
      and other means. It has experienced the alternating change process of warm period and 
      cold period, dry period and wet period. Different regions of the world have both 
      synchronous change and reverse change. <br>The scale of modern climate change is 100 to
       101 years, studied using systematic meteorological records. It is generally believed 
       that from the end of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century, large 
       areas of the Northern Hemisphere warmed, especially in the Arctic and high latitudes,
        with a significant increase in temperature, while the southern hemisphere did not 
        change much, and the warming peaked around 1940, and began to cool thereafter. The 
        causes of climate change are complex.</p>
